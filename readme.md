# Useful Scripts

This repository is just a collection of scripts that I find useful.

## Setup

Once you clone the repository where you want, all you have to do is add the right sub-directory to your `PATH`.

### Unix

If you are on a unix system, you should add the `useful-scripts/unix` directory to your `PATH`.

### Windows

If you are on Windows, you should add the `useful-scripts/windows` directory to your `PATH`.

> The shell scripts in the windows directory are there for seamless use from within the Git Bash terminal (which I use primarily).
